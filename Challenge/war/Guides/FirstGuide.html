	<p>
		So what happened? Well, when you access a webpage, your browser
		contacts the server using the HTTP protocol. <br />The server, in
		response, returns some code, and the browser tries to display it. <br />In
		the simplest case, this "code" can be just words - the browser will
		display them as such.<br />However, to create page structure (and cool
		effects!) we use languages like <a
			href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>.<br /> When a
		browser receives a response from the server that looks like HTML code,
		it tries to build a page from the HTML code. <br /> This allows for
		pages with scripts inside them, which allows for interactive pages.
		Which, today, is the vast majority of pages. <br /> <br />

		Pssst... There's a reason why this is the first challenge. <br />Often,
		when you try to figure out a challenge, you'll have to look in its
		source.
