		The first problem isn't very complicated, is it?<br />First, let's
		think what happened here. You've received a page without any apparent
		information.<br />The link itself was inside the source of the page,
		but when the browser renders it, the information doesn't show up
		anywhere.<br />I'm not saying this is going to be a common thing
		here, but who knows?
