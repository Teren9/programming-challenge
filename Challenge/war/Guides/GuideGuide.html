		This isn't a guide for solving the challenges - but instead a guide
		for understanding what you did, after you've completed a challenge. <br />
		Usually this means explanations of the concepts behind the challenge,
		some tips for easier solving, and other possible solutions you didn't
		think of. <br /> The guide isn't completed yet - some challenges
		don't have a guide yet. Sorry about that.
